## Project: Calculator GUI for Option Pricing and Monte Carlo Simulation

### Project Overview
This project is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) calculator designed to compute multiple option pricing models, including the **Black-Scholes model** and the **CRR binomial tree model**. The application also integrates **Monte Carlo Simulation** to verify if the computed option prices fall within the **95% confidence interval**. The calculator provides real-time feedback through a user-friendly interface, making complex financial calculations more accessible.

### Key Features
- **Option Pricing Models**: Includes the Black-Scholes model and the CRR binomial tree model for accurate financial option pricing.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Integrated simulation to test the accuracy of option prices and ensure they fall within a 95% confidence interval.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Users can instantly see the results of their calculations and simulations in an intuitive GUI.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simplifies complex option pricing calculations for both beginners and advanced users in finance.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language for developing the algorithm and GUI.
- **Tkinter**: Used for building the graphical user interface.
- **NumPy & SciPy**: Libraries used for numerical calculations and simulations.
- **Matplotlib**: Used to visualize the Monte Carlo simulation results.

### Development Period
**February 2022 â€“ June 2022**
